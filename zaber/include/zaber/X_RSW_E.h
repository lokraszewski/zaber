@brief      Zaber's X-RSW-E Series products are computer controlled motorized
            rotary stages with integrated controllers and motor encoders. They
            are stand-alone units requiring only a standard 24-48 V power
            supply. Built-in motor encoders allow for closed-loop operation and
            slip/stall recovery features. An indexed knob provides smooth manual
            control at variable speeds in both directions for versatile
            operation even without a computer. Press and hold to switch between
            velocity mode and distance mode, turn to move the stage, and press
            to stop. The stages connect to the USB 2.0 or RS-232 port of any
            computer and can be chained with several units per chain. They can
            also be chained with any other Zaber products. Convenient locking,
            4-pin, M8 connectors on the unit allow for easy and secure
            connection between products. The chain also shares power, so
            multiple X-Series products can use a single power supply.
